# WordPress Calendar Date Picker

[![Beerpay](https://beerpay.io/thefrosty/wp-calendar-date-picker/badge.svg?style=flat)](https://beerpay.io/thefrosty/wp-calendar-date-picker)

Show the jQuery UI datepicker on an input box next to the 'edit date' for exact date and time selection.

### Requirements

```
PHP >= 7.1
WordPress >= 5.0
```

The required WordPress version will always be the most recent point release of
the previous major release branch.

For both PHP and WordPress requirements, although this library may work with a
version below the required versions, they will not be supported and any
compatibility is entirely coincidental.

### Installation

To install this library, use Composer:

```
composer require thefrosty/wp-calendar-date-picker:^2.0
```
